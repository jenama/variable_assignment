# Variable Exercises

For this exercises we are going to create a file called `variables.js`. Copy the description of the exercise as a comment into the file and underneath write your JavaScript code.

1. Age Calculator:
    * Store your birth year in a variable. // let myBirthYear = 1991;
    * Store a future year in a variable.  //  let futureYear = 2020;
    * Calculate your 2 possible ages for that year based on the stored values. // "I will either 28 OR 29 in 2020."

    * For example, if you were born in 1988, then in 2026 you'll be either 37 or 38, depending on what month it is in 2026.
    * Log them to the screen like so: "I will be either `ageMin` or `ageMax` in `futureYear`", substituting the values.

2. Snack Supply Calculator:
    * Store your current age in a variable. var myCurrentAge = 28;
    * Store a maximum age in a variable. var maximumAge = 100;
    * Store an estimated snack amount per day (as a number). //
    var snackAmountPerDay =  2;

    * Calculate how many snacks you would eat total, from your current age until the maximum age. "You will need 2 to last you until the age of 100."
    * Log the result to the screen like this: "You will need `snackNumber` to last you until the age of `maxAge`".

3. Calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions [here](http://math2.org/math/geometry/circles.htm).
    * Use google: find how to get the number `PI` in JavaScript.
    * Store a radius into a variable. //
      let theRadius = 7;

    * Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and log "The circumference is `circumferenceResult`". //
    " The circumference is 43.9822971503."
    * Calculate the area based on the radius, and log "The area is `areaOfCircle`".

4. Temperature Converter:
    * Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
    * Convert it to fahrenheit and output "`tempInCelcius`째C is `tempInFahrenheit`째F".
    * Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
    * Convert it to celsius and output "`tempInFahrenheit`째F is `tempInCelcius`째C."


### What will be logged:
For this section write what you think will be logged as a comment next to `console.log` like so: `console.log('Cat') //'Cat'` before running the code. Then execute your file and compare with your prediction.

5.
    ```js
    let num1 = 2
    let num2 = 5
    let num3 = num1 * num2
    console.log(num3)
    ```

6.
    ```js
    let str = 'jel'
    str += 'lo'
    console.log(str)
    ```

7.
    ```js
    let string =  'My favorite number is ';
    let number = 42
    let sentence = string + number
    console.log(typeof(sentence))
    ```
